This is a reflection of my journey through UW's Trilogy Bootcamp

# My Journey

I began the Trilogy program with zero experience in coding. I barely knew HTML was an acronym. I would have figured CSS referred to a naval vessel. Over the past eight months, I have grown into a full-stack JavaScript developer. I have 32 functioning repositories under my belt. I have single handedly made apps varying from a simple quiz game to a broad, expansive library search tool. I have collaborated with varied talents to create engaging reactive web apps. In short, I feel I came to this program barely literate. I’m now speaking a strange form of poetry. The coding nuance is vast, and I look forward to learning from each and every variation in the future. 

# Future Plans

In the coming months, I plan to complete all the pre-class drills and revisit lectures to build my skill set. I will be tackling daily drills from Quora.com, completing tutorials from “Coding With Mosh” and making my way through “Cracking the Coding Interview”.  I also intend to build my network through staying in touch with classmates and reaching out to people in the industry. My journey is far from over.
